    <td>A decentralized, encrypted, peer-to-peer, trustless communications protocol for message exchange. 
   The decentralized design, outlined in "Bitmessage: A Peerâ€toâ€Peer Message Authentication and Delivery System" 
   (Warren, 2012), is conceptually based on the Bitcoin model</td>
    <td>A now-defunct U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and National Security Agency 
   (NSA) project under the Bush Sr. and Clinton administrations for publicly available strong cryptography with keys
   escrowed by the government (NIST and the Treasury Dept.). Capstone included one or more tamper-proof computer
  chips for implementation (Clipper), a secret key encryption algorithm (Skipjack), digital signature algorithm (DSA), 
  key exchange algorithm (KEA), and hash algorithm (SHA).</td>
  <td>An authentication scheme that allows one party to prove who they are to a second party by demonstrating knowledge
  of a shared secret without actually divulging that shared secret to a third party who might be listening.
  Described in RFC 1994.</td>

<h2>- In Fig. 1, the performance results show that  :</h2>

the decryption time of AES is also lower than the decryption time of DES. To conclude, the performance of AES algorithm
 in the context of encryption/decryption time is much better than the DES algorithm.

<h2>-  Encryption Time: Fig. 2 shows  :</h2>

the encryption time of DES, AES, RSA, ElGamal on different file sizes. It is clear from the figure that encryption time of
 DES algorithm is more than all other schemes such as AES, RSA, and ElGamal. The RSA encryption time is less than 
all other schemes. To conclude that, the encryption time of asymmetric algorithms is less than the symmetric algorithms.
