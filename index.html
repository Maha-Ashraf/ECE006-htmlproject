This the main page for (Cryptography kingdom) where you can know lots of information about Cryptography :
First - Definition of 'Cryptography' : What is it ??
Cryptography is a method of protecting information and communications through the use of codes,
 so that only those for whom the information is intended can read and process it.
 The prefix "crypt-" means "hidden" or "vault" -- and the suffix "-graphy" stands for "writing."
In computer science, cryptography refers to secure information and communication techniques derived from mathematical 
concepts and a set of rule-based calculations called algorithms, to transform messages in ways that are hard to decipher.
 These deterministic algorithms are used for cryptographic key generation, digital signing, verification to protect data 
privacy, web browsing on the internet, and confidential communications 
such as credit card transactions and email.
